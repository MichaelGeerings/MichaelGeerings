Hi, 

I'm Michael Geerings, and live in the Netherlands near Eindhoven.

Until 2020 I worked at Philips Research and from 2013 joined the SL-HDR project,
a joined partnership between Technicolor and Philips Research to deliver a HDR standard that describes dynamic meta-data 
to accomplish either HDR_with_SDR-metadata or SDR_with_HDR-meta data from one single layer.


Meanwhile i'm happily retrired, but still interested in macOS, Python3, still photography, HDR videoprocessing, colormetrics, colorgrading, high-end content creation, visualisation and machine learning developments.
